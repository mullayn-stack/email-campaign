Must-haves (polish + reliability)

Safe auth: hash the admin password (bcrypt) and use a session/JWT instead of raw Basic Auth; rate-limit /admin/update.

Validation: email format checks, duplicate recipient detection, and a soft guard if no recipients are set.

Preview & test send: live preview of the merged email (with your name/postcode), plus a “Send test to me” that opens a mailto: with your address only.

Copy-to-clipboard fallback: button to copy the final subject/body if the user’s device blocks mailto: handlers.

Length guard: mailto: length caps vary (~2k chars is a common cliff). Show a counter + warn when body is too long, offer a “short version” fallback.

Autosave & persistence: store last-used name/postcode/note in localStorage so users don’t retype if they come back.

Smart personalisation & targeting

Template variables: already using {{name}} and {{postcode}}; add custom ones like {{town}}, {{constituency}}, {{today}} and a simple conditional block syntax (e.g., {{#if note}}...{{/if}}).

Per-recipient variants: let admin define different subjects/bodies per recipient (or per group/tag), or auto-iterate one email per recipient (better deliverability than one giant To: line).

Recipient import/export: CSV paste/upload in Admin with columns for name,email,tag.

UX & conversion

Multi-client buttons: “Open in Gmail,” “Open in Outlook,” “Default Mail App.” (Gmail/Outlook web URLs need different query params than mailto:).

Share pack: one-click share links for WhatsApp/Twitter/Facebook with a short explainer + URL.

PWA mode: installable, offline-friendly splash that still lets people draft/copy their email.

Trust, compliance, safety

Privacy notice & consent checkbox: if you log anything (even just click events), state it. Add GDPR-friendly consent for optional updates.

Basic anti-abuse: hCaptcha on Admin, and origin check on POST /admin/update.

Content safety hints: nudge users to add a personal sentence (reduces spam filtering and looks human).

Deliverability helpers

Line-wrap & URL-encoding sanity: ensure CRLF/newlines are normalized and % encoding is correct; trim trailing spaces to avoid broken links.

One-recipient mode: option to open a new compose window per recipient (sequence), not a single massive mailto:. (Better chance of getting read.)

Short/long template pair: “long” version for copy/paste; “short” version for mailto:.

Admin quality of life

Template library & A/B: save multiple named templates; toggle A/B for subject lines and track which was chosen more often.

Analytics (privacy-light): count “Send Email” clicks, template usage, and per-recipient open attempts (no tracking pixels, just on-site events).

Change history: keep a simple JSON version log with timestamp, admin user, and diff summary; add “revert” button.

Accessibility & styling

WCAG pass: larger hit-targets, proper labels, contrast checks, focus states, and aria-live updates for status messages.

Mobile layout polish: sticky “Send” bar on small screens; input masks for postcode.

Optional power-ups (if you want to go further)

Postcode → representative lookup: auto-populate recipients from a postcode (NI/UK data sources) and lock the list in the compose step.

PDF letter generator: create a nicely formatted PDF users can print or attach manually.

QR code: generate a QR that opens the prefilled email on a phone.

Webhook mode: optional endpoint so campaigns elsewhere can update this app’s config.
